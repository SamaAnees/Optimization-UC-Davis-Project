# Optimization-UC-Davis-Project

Stock Portfolio Optimization Project

This MATLAB script uses the Markowitz Model for achieving a desired rate of return by minimizing risk.
The script uses the CVX package to achieve this goal.

return_range.m returns num linearly spaced rates of return
between the rate of return of the portfolio with minimum risk and the
maximum possible rate of return.

efficient frontier.m returns a curve which plots the expected rate of return and standard deviation of each of
the efficient portfolios.
